/*
 * NOTE: 
 * The documentation below is slightly out of date but mostly still correct,
 * and only for gen i trades. Gen ii trades are very similar but have a few
 * different patterns. I'm currently lazy and working on features, so better
 * documentation on the trade protocol to follow, and potentially will push
 * it all to bulbapedia or similar for the world to benefit from.
 *
 *
 * This setup always forces the flipper to the follower/slave role in the link.
 * This just makes our logic consistent and since we're going to be gobs faster
 * than a real Game Boy, we can be guaranteed to always be ready to respond.
 *
 * As documented here: http://www.adanscotney.com/2014/01/spoofing-pokemon-trades-with-stellaris.html
 * The general gist of the communication is as follows:
 * 1) Each Game Boy tries to listen for an external clock coming in on the link cable.
 *     After some unknown timeout, this Game Boy decides its going to take the leader/master role.
 *     In this state, it generates a clock and repeatedly sends out PKMN_MASTER(0x01)
 * 2) The other side, sensing a clock from the leader/master, then responds with PKMN_SLAVE(0x02)
 * 3) Once both sides understand their roles, they both respond with PKMN_BLANK(0x00) for a bit.
 * 4) Next, the leader/master sends CONNECTED(0x60) bytes that the follower/slave repeats
 *     back. Then a bunch of BLANK bytes.
 * 5) At this point, each Game Boy repeatedly sends the menu item it has highlighted,
 *     prepended by a BLANK, in groups of 3 bytes. These are ITEM_*_HIGHLIGHTED.
 * 6) Then, once both sides send ITEM_*_SELECTED, the next step occurs.
 *     This application, from steps 3 through 6, just repeats bytes back and lets the Game Boy
 *     dictate the steps. We stay here until we start seeing PREAMBLE(0xFD) bytes,
 *     as those dictate the start of the next sections.
 *
 * The Flipper is now in the "READY" state.
 *
 * 7) Once the player on the Game Boy side uses the trade table, a block of data is
 *     transmitted. This starts with 10x PREAMBLE(0xFD) bytes, 10x random bytes (to
 *
 *     I missed another 9x fd bytes after rand? State machine below confirms these bytes
 *
 *     sync the RNG between two devices, unused at this time), and then the 415 trade_block,
 *     struct gets transferred. At the end of this is 3 ending bytes, DF FE 15. And, weirdly,
 *     3 PREAMBLE(0xFD) bytes.
 * 8) The patch list starts with 3x more PREAMBLE(0xFD) bytes for a total of 6x PREAMBLE,
 *     followed by 7x BLANK bytes. Then remaining 189 bytes of patch list data. The patch
 *     list is used to compensate for byte values of NO_DATA_BYE(0xFE) being transmitted.
 *     The patch list is specifically for the party data of the trade_block. To patch
 *     outgoing data, if a byte is 0xFE, it is changed to 0xFF, and the index+1 is
 *     added to the patch list. There are two parts to the patch list as the data it
 *     covers is longer than 0xFC. After each part is complete, 0xFF is added to the
 *     patch list. The first part of the patch list can patch 0x00:0xFB of the party,
 *     the second part can patch 0xFC:0x107 of the party. If there are no bytes to
 *     patch in a part, 0xFF is just appended. After both terminators, it is expected
 *     all remaining bytes are 0x00.
 *
 * The Flipper is now in the "WAITING" state.
 *
 * 9) At this point, both sides have full copies of each other's current party. The sides
 *     simply indicate which Pokemon they are sending. This is done with a BLANK byte to
 *     start, and then each side indicates which Pokemon it wants to trade with SEL_NUM_MASK(0x60)
 *     + party index. We always transmit the first Pokemon. Once in a agreement, both
 *     sides transmit a handful of BLANK bytes.
 *
 * The Flipper is now in the "DEAL?" state.
 *
 * A) Starting with another BLANK byte, both sides need to agree to the trade by
 *     sending TRADE_ACCEPT(0x62) repeatedly, and then a handful of BLANK bytes.
 *     To disagree with a trade, either side would send TRADE_REJECT(0x61), the
 *     Flipper will never send this on its own. If the Game Boy does, both it and
 *     the flipper got back to step 9 again.
 *
 * The Flipper is now in the "TRADING" state.
 *
 * B) The Flipper actually goes back to step 7, but keeps the drawing mode as
 *     TRADING. After the trade is complete on the Game Boy, it re-sends the
 *     trade_block data. This re-syncs the states between the Flipper and
 *     Game Boy and another trade can occur.
 *
 * *) A point of note is that the Flipper can go back to the main menu from
 *     any state. Though, doing so in the TRADING state might actually cause
 *     the Game Boy to have issues. When in READY or WAITING state, the Flipper
 *     can go back and modify the Pokemon that the Game Boy sent to it. If the
 *     Flipper then goes back to Trade from the main menu, it will be in the
 *     READY state. If the Game Boy is still on the trade menu, and it tries
 *     to trade, the trade will be rejected. The Game Boy needs to exit the
 *     trade menu, and then re-enter it by selecting the table in the trade
 *     center. This will then push the Flipper to the WAITING state, and the
 *     trade_blocks will re-sync between them with the new data. If the Game Boy
 *     leave the trade menu while the Flipper is in the WAITING state, the
 *     Flipper will go back to the READY state.
